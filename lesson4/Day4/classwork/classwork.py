#example2    
#remember: if we have tabs beween "if"s, first "if" will be main

#first "if" will work because 7>3 and 3 will be printed.
#second 'if" will not work (7<5-false) 
#third "if" will not be even chacked!

#1)#exponentiation operator- print(5**4) the result will be : 5*5*5*5

#2)# For loop- e.g for char in sting1:
#                    if char in "aeiou"
#                       amount_of_vowels_in_name1+=1
#how does it work:using name "nika"
#1) for loop will  check name "nika" forth time
#2)each letter will be chacked: if letter "n" is in "aeiou", vowels' variable  will be increase with 1
#3)if letter"i" is in "aeiou", vowels' variable  will be increase with 1
#4)if letter "k" is in "aeiou", vowels' variable  will be increase with 1
#4)if letter "a" is in "aeiou", vowels' variable  will be increase with 1

#3)elif-else if (same as if.when we want to check another statment.it will wokr if first "if" will not work in specific situation)

#4)== operator- it meats: if left variable is equal to wright variable.
# e.g  for char in string: 
#          if char=="a": # in "" - you have to write the char,that you are looking for 
#         amount_of_a_in_string+=1

#5)#multifle "if"-s - second if will be checked if first 'if'  works.
#remember: if we have tabs beween "if"s, first "if" will be main
# if there is no space between "if"-s,then every "if" will be main
